# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tool

## Overview

This tool can be used to produce basic statistics and graphical displays without any necessary end-user coding.

## Project Plan

A graphical user interface (GUI) will be coded in python. This GUI will instruct the user to upload a .csv file containing a dataset with an outcome (y) and predictor(s) (x). The back-end code will then read in the data. The next screen of the GUI will then instruct the user of which variable is the outcome and which are the predictors. The GUI will also have different options for the tool to generate which the user can select through a square checkbox, including:

* Boxplot
* Scatterplot matrix
* Correlation matrix
* Residual plots
* Basic statistic table
* Linear regression model with summary statistics
* Stepwise selection to suggest the most influential predictors

Once the user submits their selection, the GUI will output the graphical displays and statistics.
